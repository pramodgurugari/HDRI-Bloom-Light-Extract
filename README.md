HDRIs capture real-world lighting conditions, including bright light sources such as the sun, artificial lights, or reflections. Bloom light extraction from an HDRI highlights natural light behavior, such as the softening and spilling of light around bright areas, creating a more realistic effect.
Often, HDRIs are cleaned up by removing the sun and surrounding areas to use them as diffuse maps in 3D software. However, this approach is not ideal.
Why Extract the Sun and Bloom?
The sun in an HDRI has specific values, including its proper range and temperature, which correspond to the exact time and place of capture. These values are crucial for accurate rendering of reflections and refractions in a 3D scene.
Similarly, the areas surrounding the sun also have distinct ranges that are just as important as the sun itself. By carefully extracting bloom, you can preserve these critical details and achieve more precise and realistic results in your renders.

When you first open the HDRI Bloom Light Extract Gizmo Tool, you’ll find several key options to help you manage and fine-tune your HDRI settings:
Exposure Check:
This feature is designed to help you verify the exposure within the HDRI range. It’s primarily for checking purposes and should be disabled once you’ve completed your exposure verification.
Enable Bloom Extract:
If you’d like to automate the bloom extraction process, enable this option. It simplifies the workflow by automatically extracting bloom effects from the HDRI.
Adjustable Parameters:
The tool provides customizable parameters like Range, Range Rolloff, Blur Size, and Blur Edge. You can adjust these settings to achieve your desired results. Make sure that the Range is set appropriately to capture the required effect.
SunRemove:
This feature allows you to remove the sun from the bloom light. When enabled, a CROP Box will appear, which you can use to target the sun. Align the box with the sun's center and adjust its size, width, and height as needed to fit the sun precisely.
Final Adjustments:
After aligning the CROP Box, fine-tune the parameters to remove the sun while preserving the surrounding values and details. This ensures that the overall HDRI integrity is maintained.
By utilizing these options, the HDRI Bloom Light Extract Gizmo Tool provides you with powerful controls to effectively manage bloom lighting in your scenes while customizing settings to meet your specific needs.
